                <h1><p>andlocked, communist, studded with limestone spires and gilded temples, riddled with caves and home to rare wildlife, Laos has a unique charm for adventurous travellers. They relish its sleepy atmosphere, charming people and the sharp contrast with Thailand or Vietnam.</p>

<p>If you don’t have the backpacker’s luxury of boundless time and can only spend a couple of weeks in Laos, it’s an idea to focus on one region or cherry-pick sites connected by flights using Lao Airlines. With long distances and less-than-great roads (this is one of the least-developed countries in south-east Asia), river and air transport make sense. Check out also the hop-on, hop-off Stray Travel passes (one week from $389).</p>
